Euler's identity is often cited as the most beautiful equation in mathematics. It connects five of the most important constants in mathematics:

$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$

Here:
- **e** is Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms.
- **i** is the imaginary unit.
- **$\pi$** is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
- **1** is the multiplicative identity.
- **0** is the additive identity.

This simple equation combines arithmetic, calculus, trigonometry, and complex analysis into one elegant statement.
